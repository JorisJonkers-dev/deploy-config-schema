# Feature Specification: Deploy Config Schema Design

**Feature Branch**: `spec/initial`
**Feature Directory**: `specs/001-deploy-config-schema-design`
**Status**: Initial implementation
**Created**: 2026-06-08

## Overview

ExtraToast/deploy-config-schema defines a versioned contract for a JSON-schema-driven deploy and infrastructure configuration artifact. The artifact is intended to describe fleet, service, exposure, access, ingress, monitoring, and image rollout intent once platform boundaries are proven outside this repository.

The design is based on the current personal-stack fleet inventory, platform tooling, and render scripts, with website used as a read-only compatibility reference for version metadata, Kubernetes GitOps deployment, and Keel-managed image rollouts. The desired outcome is a versioned schema plus command surface that downstream repositories can consume to validate declarative config and generate operational artifacts without copying downstream-specific render logic.

This repository is distributed as a versioned artifact. personal-stack and website consume pinned versions through Renovate when they opt into the schema. personal-stack remains continuously auto-deployed from its own repository and is not converted into a versioned product. Published coordinates must stay short and must not use doubled plugin-marker names.

This feature now includes an initial implementation skeleton. The skeleton must define the JSON schema, package metadata, validating CLI, deterministic adapter command surface, a sample config, and at least one adapter that renders sample output. Gatus, edge catalog, edge route catalog, and image metadata adapters may remain explicit command stubs in this slice when their TODO status is documented and traceable. The feature must not apply generated output, modify downstream repositories, drive live platform changes, or define a migration plan that applies generated output.

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Validate deployment intent before rendering

A platform maintainer edits a declarative deploy config modeled after personal-stack's fleet inventory. The config is validated against the published JSON schema before any adapter output is generated. Invalid references, duplicate service classifications, unsupported exposure modes, and malformed backend definitions are reported with stable diagnostics that identify the offending path.

### Scenario 2: Generate edge ingress artifacts from one source of truth

A downstream repository consumes a pinned deploy-config-schema artifact and runs a CLI command against its deploy config. The Traefik adapter produces public and LAN IngressRoute manifests that reflect exposure intent, access intent, host labels, root redirects, route exceptions, backend service targets, and WAN origin overrides.

### Scenario 3: Generate status and edge catalog artifacts

A downstream repository runs the Gatus and edge catalog adapters against the same validated config. The generated outputs describe service exposure, access class, hostnames, route rules, internal and external health probes, HTTP and TCP checks, and monitoring-only endpoints without requiring separate manually maintained catalog files.

### Scenario 4: Describe image rollout metadata consistently

A downstream repository records image metadata for first-party and third-party workloads in the deploy config. The image metadata adapter reports image names, tag strategy, pull policy, Keel annotations, and poll cadence so the current latest-tag rollout behavior can be audited and generated consistently where a consumer opts in.

### Scenario 5: Consume the artifact through pinned versions

personal-stack and website depend on the published deploy-config-schema artifact using short coordinates pinned by Renovate when each repository opts in. Updating the schema or CLI is a dependency update in the consumer repository, not a change to the consumer's own deployment versioning model.

## Functional Requirements (FR-n)

- FR-1: The JSON schema must define a top-level deploy config document with version, cluster, sites, nodes, service intent, placement intent, exposure intent, access intent, ingress intent, monitoring intent, image metadata, and adapter output intent.
- FR-2: The schema must support the current personal-stack inventory concepts: cluster public domain, Kubernetes bootstrap metadata, site networking, node status, node roles, node capabilities, GPU placement preferences, service groups, public/LAN/internal exposure classes, SSO protection, host labels, root redirects, Kubernetes backend references, health endpoints, extra probes, and WAN origin overrides.
- FR-3: The schema must validate cross-references between services, sites, nodes, exposure entries, placement entries, access entries, backend entries, monitoring entries, host labels, image metadata, and adapter output selections.
- FR-4: The schema must reject duplicate or contradictory service classifications, including a service listed in more than one exposure class or an external route requested for a service without a host label.
- FR-5: The schema must allow YAML and JSON source documents to be validated against the same JSON schema contract.
- FR-6: The CLI contract must include a validation command that returns success for valid input and structured diagnostics for invalid input, including a stable code, a human-readable message, and the config path involved.
- FR-7: The CLI contract must include adapter commands that can write deterministic output to stdout and, when requested by the consumer, to a configured output path.
- FR-8: Adapter output must be deterministic: equivalent input must produce stable ordering, stable document separators, stable names, and no timestamps or machine-local paths.
- FR-9: The Traefik adapter must generate public IngressRoute documents for services in `public` and `public_and_lan` exposure classes that also have Kubernetes backend definitions.
- FR-10: The Traefik adapter must generate LAN IngressRoute documents for services in `public_and_lan` and `lan_only` exposure classes that also have Kubernetes backend definitions.
- FR-11: The Traefik adapter must model ingress class, namespace, route name, host match, path prefixes, exact paths, excluded paths, backend namespace, backend service, backend port, TLS, root redirect middleware, SSO middleware, and external DNS target annotations.
- FR-12: The Traefik adapter must support WAN origin overrides equivalent to `home_direct` and `edge_direct`, including whether the generated DNS target is proxied or direct.
- FR-13: The route model must represent path-specific route exceptions without hard-coding service names in the schema, including split API/UI hosts, unauthenticated health paths, and token-protected non-browser paths.
- FR-14: The Gatus adapter must generate a ConfigMap-compatible endpoints document for ingress backends and monitoring-only backends.
- FR-15: The Gatus adapter must support HTTP and TCP probes, explicit health paths, probe ports that differ from route ports, expected status codes, response time conditions, internal probes, external probes, combined internal/external probes, service groups, and extra probes.
- FR-16: The Gatus adapter must default SSO-protected HTTP services and TCP services to internal probing unless the config explicitly requests another probe strategy.
- FR-17: The edge catalog adapter must generate a service catalog with cluster name, service name, exposure class, access class, and fully qualified host when a host label exists.
- FR-18: The edge route catalog adapter must generate route entries with route name, owning service, host, access class, path prefixes, exact paths, excluded path prefixes, and excluded exact paths.
- FR-19: The image metadata adapter must represent container image repository, tag, pull policy, update eligibility, Keel policy annotations, match-tag behavior, trigger mode, and poll schedule.
- FR-20: The image metadata model must distinguish first-party latest-tag workloads from pinned third-party workloads so generated or audited Keel metadata does not mark pinned images for unintended rollout.
- FR-21: The design must reserve a future extension area for Nomad job inputs without requiring Nomad schema fields or rendering support in this feature.
- FR-22: The design must state that platform boundary proof is a prerequisite for implementation work; this repository must not drive live platform changes before that proof exists.
- FR-23: The distribution design must allow personal-stack and website to consume versioned artifacts through Renovate-pinned dependency coordinates while personal-stack remains continuously auto-deployed and unversioned as an application.
- FR-24: The distribution design must require short artifact coordinates and must forbid doubled plugin-marker names.
- FR-25: The primary first-class consumer set must include both personal-stack and website, with adoption remaining optional and consumer-owned for each repository.
- FR-26: The first published artifact format must be an npm package named `@extratoast/deploy-config-schema` that contains the JSON schema and CLI contract entrypoints; any future Maven, OCI, or other artifact must use an equally short ExtraToast coordinate without repeated marker terms.
- FR-27: The compatibility promise for route exception behavior must use a generic route-rule model that can represent the known personal-stack special cases without preserving every current service-specific name.

## Success Criteria (SC-n, measurable)

- SC-1: A config equivalent to the non-secret portions of personal-stack's current fleet inventory can be represented by the schema with zero validation errors.
- SC-2: At least one invalid fixture for each required cross-reference class fails validation: missing site, missing node, missing service, missing backend, missing host label, duplicate exposure entry, and unsupported health probe type.
- SC-3: Running the same implemented adapter twice against the same valid input produces byte-for-byte identical output, and stubbed adapters return deterministic TODO diagnostics until implemented.
- SC-4: The Traefik public output includes only services that are public or public-and-LAN and have Kubernetes backends; the LAN output includes only services that are public-and-LAN or LAN-only and have Kubernetes backends.
- SC-5: Every generated Traefik route includes ingress class, host match, backend namespace, backend service, backend port, TLS configuration, and required middleware or DNS annotations when applicable.
- SC-6: The Gatus adapter contract identifies one endpoint for every eligible ingress backend and monitoring backend, plus every declared extra probe, sorted by group and endpoint name; the initial skeleton may expose this as a TODO stub.
- SC-7: The Gatus adapter contract requires HTTP endpoints to include status and response time conditions, while TCP endpoints include a connection condition; the initial skeleton may expose this as a TODO stub.
- SC-8: The edge catalog adapter contract contains one entry for every service with exposure intent and includes exposure, access, and host fields where applicable; the initial skeleton may expose this as a TODO stub.
- SC-9: The edge route catalog adapter contract contains all declared route rules and can be compared mechanically to generated Traefik route names; the initial skeleton may expose this as a TODO stub.
- SC-10: The image metadata adapter contract identifies all configured images, separates latest-tag Keel-managed workloads from pinned third-party workloads, and reports poll cadence for every Keel-managed workload; the initial skeleton may expose this as a TODO stub.
- SC-11: The distribution section names `@extratoast/deploy-config-schema` as the initial short coordinate, and a Renovate rule can pin that coordinate without causing doubled plugin-marker names.
- SC-12: No generated output application, downstream repository edit, live deployment action, or Nomad job rendering is required to complete this initial skeleton.

## Assumptions

- Source config may be authored as YAML or JSON, but validation is governed by the JSON schema.
- The current personal-stack fleet inventory is the seed domain model, not a mandate to preserve its exact file shape.
- website is a compatibility reference for production GitOps and Keel behavior, not a writable target during this feature.
- Adapter outputs are text artifacts suitable for GitOps repositories.
- The first distribution package is published as `@extratoast/deploy-config-schema`; additional package ecosystems are future extensions rather than initial requirements.
- Secrets, token values, certificate material, and runtime credentials are not represented in the schema.
- The schema version is independent from personal-stack's deployment cadence.
- Renovate can pin the deploy-config-schema artifact in downstream repositories without changing their release model.
- Nomad support is reserved for a later feature after Kubernetes-oriented boundaries are stable.

## Edge Cases

- A service appears in more than one exposure class.
- A service has a host label but no backend for a requested route adapter.
- A service requests public exposure without a host label.
- A public route has a WAN origin override but the referenced site has no WAN IP.
- A LAN route is requested when no LAN ingress site or class exists.
- A health probe port differs from the routed service port.
- A TCP probe declares an HTTP-only expectation.
- An SSO-protected service requests external probing without an explicit probe strategy.
- A root host label maps to the bare public domain instead of a subdomain.
- Route include and exclude rules overlap.
- A route exception creates a duplicate route name after LAN suffixing.
- A first-party image uses a pinned tag while Keel metadata requests latest-tag matching.
- A third-party pinned image is accidentally marked for automatic rollout.
